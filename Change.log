Change log:

v. 1.09: Added check at module startup for criical hooks - if for example after Swifkey update module can not hook esential methods, it should exit and let Swifkey work with stock themes... Otherwise Swiftkey might delete all our custom themes. 
Added new preference to enable exporting filtered logcat to "/sdcard/Xswiftkey.logcat" at boot time. Provide it to get better support.

v. 1.08: Removed save theme service required permission for better compatibility. New option to override Swiftkey theme preferences title with your themes location, app icon refresh.

v.1.07: Fixed bug: unable to browse folders if already selected theme folder path was changed(folder renamed, old path not exists). Added some user useful logging in logcat: now if you enable debug, restart android and read logcat, module will detect if there is inconsistencies in your themes and themelist - existing theme folders but missing in themelist(warning message in blue) and themes listed in themelist but missing in your theme folder(error message in red)... if any. These inconsistencies will not cause any problems(module takes care of that) but is good to keep themes folder clean...

v.1.06: Throwing the theme if is in themelist but do not exist in theme folder so Swiftkey wont crash.

v.1.05: Improved themes type handling, improved save current theme handling, some user experience improvements in Choose themelist dialog.

v. 1.04: For Android 6.0 now module should ask for read /sdcard permission if can't read it. Improved logic for how Swiftkey should add themes, added option in Module settings to enable debugging in logcat.

v. 1.03: Rebuild module with Android 6.0 SDK to see if will help with some users not seeing themes in Swiftkey Beta.

v. 1.02: Fixed force close if "assets" themes have same ID as my themes, like if you use "assets" SuperSwiftkey themes folder.

v. 1.01: Fixed bug with selecting themelist from theme folder with too many subfolders, like the one from SuperSwiftkey themes.

v. 1.0: Initial release.
