# XSwiftkey
Xposed module to apply Swiftkey themes from external storage + resizing key text labels. No more need to decompile/recompile Swiftkey just to add your favorite themes after every update...
Just set your themelist.json, enable key label resize if you wish, restart android and your themes will be listed in Swiftkey themes setting just like any build-in theme... Apply it, done...
Enjoy!
